# **Own Python IDEðŸ–¥**
###  This is a normal/small python IDE made with python itself. But to get it perfectly work, it requires *Python* Environment mainly. I created this for learning and doing project side by side to relate this. Currently don't have any feature with it.
***
## **Prerequisites**
  - Python 3.9.5
  - Visual Studio Code
  
## **Workflow**
  I went through the `Documentation` available on https://www.python.org/doc/ . There I learned about `TKinter`.

  `TKinter` module used for building GUI applications.
  `Subprocess` module allows you to spawn processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes.
  
  So I imported these libraries 
  ```py
  from tkinter import *
from tkinter.filedialog import asksaveasfilename, askopenfilename
import subprocess
```

## **If I will run the [ide.py](./ide.py) file** 
 **IDE looks like**

**This IDE named as *Python Battlefield*. But after writing code, I have to save it unless it won't run. Will ask for to save first**

**After saving, it will run**
